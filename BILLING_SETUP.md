## Access Control Examples

### Server-Side Access Control

export default async function Page() {
  const { has } = await auth()
  
  // Check for specific plans
  const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'premium' })
  const hasProAccess = has({ plan: 'pro' })
  
  // Check for specific features
  const hasAdvancedAnalytics = has({ feature: 'advanced-analytics' })
  
  if (!hasPremiumAccess) {
    return <div>Premium access required</div>
  }
  
  return <div>Premium content here</div>
}
```

### Client-Side Access Control
```typescript
'use client'
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export function FeatureComponent() {
  const { has } = useAuth()
  
  const hasFeature = has({ feature: 'custom-branding' })
  
  return (
    <div>
      {hasFeature ? (
        <div>Feature available!</div>
      ) : (
        <div>Upgrade to access this feature</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using the Protect Component
```typescript
import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export function ProtectedContent() {
  return (
    <Protect
      plan="premium"
      fallback={<div>Premium subscription required</div>}
    >
      <div>Premium content here</div>
    </Protect>
  )
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Billing in Clerk Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Billing Settings page in your Clerk Dashboard
2. Enable billing for your application
3. Choose your payment gateway (Clerk development gateway for testing, or your own Stripe account)

### 2. Create Plans
1. Go to the Plans page in the Clerk Dashboard
2. Select "Plans for Users" tab
3. Create your subscription plans (e.g., Basic, Pro, Premium)
4. Add features to each plan as needed

### 3. Configure Features
Add features to your plans that you want to use for access control:
- `advanced-analytics`
- `priority-support`
- `custom-branding`
- `api-access`
- etc.

### 4. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are already configured:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_cG9saXRlLWRvdmUtMC5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk

```

## Testing the Integration

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Visit the home page
   - Sign up for a new account
   - Navigate to `/pricing` to see available plans
   - Subscribe to a plan
   - Visit `/premium` to see access control in action

3. **Test access control:**

   - Subscribe to different plans and see how access changes
   - Test both plan-based and feature-based protection

## Key Components
